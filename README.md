# Hangman Project Documentation

## Completed steps:
- Defined a list of possible words for the game.
- Implemented random selection of a word from the list.
- Asked the user for a letter input and validated the input.

## Challenges encountered:
- No significant challenges encountered so far.

## Lessons learned:
- How to use Python's `random.choice()` function.
- How to validate user input effectively.
## Completed steps:
- Defined a list of possible words for the game.
- Implemented random selection of a word from the list.
- Asked the user for a letter input and validated the input.
- Created the main game loop to manage user guesses and limit the number of attempts.

## Challenges encountered:
- Ensuring users do not repeat letters they've guessed before.

## Lessons learned:
- Managing loops effectively in Python.
- Implementing basic game logic and state management.
